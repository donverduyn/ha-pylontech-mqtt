# Pylontech Serial Integration for Home Assistant

[![HACS Custom](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

Connect your Pylontech US2000/US3000/US5000 battery stack directly to Home Assistant using a USB-to-RS232/RS485 cable.

## Features
- **Direct Serial Connection**: Reads battery data directly from the Console port.
- **Home Assistant Native**: No MQTT or Docker containers required.
- **Energy Dashboard Ready**: Includes calculated Energy (kWh) sensors for proper dashboard Integration.
- **Per-Battery Monitoring**: Voltage, Current, SOC, Temperature, and Status for each module.
- **Per-Battery Configuration**: Individually tune the capacity of each battery module (Number entity) to accurately compute total stored energy.
- **Diagnostics & Raw Data**: Track system health (SOH), cycle count, firmware version, and view raw serial responses for debugging.
- **Time Synchronization**: Automatically or manually sync Home Assistant's time with your BMS internal clock.
- **Custom Commands**: Send arbitrary raw serial commands directly to the BMS using the built-in Home Assistant service.

> [!WARNING]
> **Disclaimer:** This integration interacts directly with your hardware. Incorrect configuration or usage could potentially cause damage to your batteries or connected devices. The creators and contributors of this integration take **no responsibility** for any damage, data loss, or other issues that may arise from using this software. Use at your own risk.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This integration is not affiliated with or endorsed by Pylontech.
> It is a completely independent project, backed up by the community, and based on official documentation, commands, and reverse engineering.

> [!NOTE]
> **USB Auto-Discovery**: Currently, **only** the Prolic PL2303 scanner (VID `067B`, PID `2303`) is supported for auto-discovery. If you have a different adapter, it will not be automatically detected, but you can still manually select the port during configuration.

## Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)

1.  Ensure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed.
2.  Go to **HACS > Integrations**.
3.  Click the **3 dots** (top right) > **Custom repositories**.
4.  Add the URL of this repository.
5.  Category: **Integration**.
6.  Click **Add**, then find and install **Pylontech Serial**.
7.  Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1. **Locate your configuration directory**: Find your Home Assistant `config` folder (where `configuration.yaml` lives).
2. **Create custom_components**: If it doesn't exist, create a folder named `custom_components` inside your `config` folder.
3. **Copy files**: Copy the `pylontech_serial` folder from `custom_components/` in this repository to your Home Assistant's `custom_components/` folder.
   - Resulting path: `/config/custom_components/pylontech_serial/`
4. **Restart Home Assistant**: This is crucial for HA to recognize the new component.

## Configuration

1. Connect your Pylontech battery to the machine running Home Assistant via USB.
2. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
3. Click **+ ADD INTEGRATION** in the bottom right.
4. Search for **Pylontech Serial**.
5. Select your Serial Port from the list.
6. Configure the Baud Rate (Default 115200) and Poll Interval (Default 15 seconds) if needed.
7. Click **Submit**.

### Battery Capacity Configuration
Instead of a global configuration, this integration provides a **Number Entity** for *each* detected battery module. Once the integration is added, navigate to the device page for each module to adjust its capacity (in kWh). This ensures that the integration accurately calculates the total stored energy across batteries of different sizes.

### Hardware Configuration
Ensure your battery DIP switches are configured correctly for communication. For US2000/US3000/US5000, **all DIP switches OFF** selects the default baud rate of **115200**.

## Energy Dashboard Setup

To track your battery usage in the Energy Dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Dashboards** > **Energy**.
2. Find the **Battery Systems** section and click **Add Battery System**.
3. For **Energy going in to the battery**, select: `sensor.pylontech_stack_system_energy_charged`
4. For **Energy coming out of the battery**, select: `sensor.pylontech_stack_system_energy_discharged`
5. Click **Save**.

## Troubleshooting
- **No data?**: Check that the correct serial port is selected and that the cable is plugged into the **Console** port of the Master battery (not CAN/RS485 unless using a specific adapter).
- **Permissions**: If running Home Assistant Core in Docker (not OS), ensure the device is passed through (`--device /dev/ttyUSB0`).
